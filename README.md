# Imperial_Predict
ImperialPredict is a grade calculator for Imperial College students. It lets you input marks for coursework and exams to calculate your weighted module scores and overall year average. 

This is a personal project aimed at simplifying the grade tracking process, replacing manual spreadsheets with a dedicated tool.

## Features

- Real-Time Calculation: instantly updates module and year averages as you input grades.

- Weighted Scoring: handles complex module weightings and credit values automatically.

- Degree Classification: displays your current predicted degree class (1st, 2:1, 2:2) based on official mark bands.

- Exclusions: allows you to ignore specific assignments or modules that you haven't completed yet to get an accurate "current" average.

## Supported Courses

Currently, the application supports the following:

- Computing (BEng/MEng) - Year 1

## Contributing and Contact

I hope to expand this tool to support more years and other courses (Aeronautics, EEE, Mechanical Engineering, etc.).

If you would like your course added, please contact me with a list of your modules, their ECTS credit values, and the breakdown of assignments/exams. I can update the system quickly with the correct data.
